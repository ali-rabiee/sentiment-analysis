# **Sentiment Analysis**


### *Sentiment analysis of IMDB dataset.*

sentiment analysis on IMDB dataset: In this project, I use different data pre-processing techniques, such as  Stop words removal, stemming, lemma, and so on. Then I use different models to classification of comments. Also, I evaluate different clustering methods on this dataset.

### *IMDB dataset has 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.*


This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.
